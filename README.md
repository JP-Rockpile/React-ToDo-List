# React-ToDo-List

This is a React App that allows users to enter items and add them to a ToDo List. Clicking on the items removes them from the list. 

A roadmap for future changes might include adding a plus button next to the Add ToDo input field to increase UX. Another function might to be able to click and drag the ToDo list and place it around the page. Another addition might be to add a tab of completed tasks once they are clicked on and removed from the active to do list. Adding mulitple lists with different dates.
